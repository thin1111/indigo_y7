                        The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic and wireless, networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services.
                        The Internet has transformed the world of computers and communication in ways never seen before. Earlier innovations like the telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer laid the foundation for this remarkable fusion of technologies. Today, the Internet acts as a worldwide hub for communication, information exchange, and seamless collaboration between individuals and their devices, no matter where they are. It exemplifies the incredible outcomes of continuous investment and commitment to advancing technological infrastructure.
                        In 1973, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched a research initiative to explore methods for connecting different types of packet networks. The goal was to create communication protocols that would enable seamless interaction between computers across interconnected networkThis initiative, known as the Internetting project, ultimately gave rise to what we now call the "Internet." It also led to the creation of the TCP/IP Protocol Suite, which is named after its two core protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).

                        Don't give your personal or financial information.
Understanding why people engage in online conversations with strangers can be insightful.
The reasons vary from individual to individual, but for some, itâ€™s simply an enjoyable way to spend their time.
Make sure youâ€™re using a secure Internet connection.
When connecting to the internet, prioritise safety by using secure networks. Public Wi-Fi, while convenient, can pose significant risks as its security cannot be guaranteed.
To stay safe, refrain from performing sensitive tasks such as banking or shopping online when connected to public Wi-Fi. Instead, save these activities for a secure, private network you trust. If you need to do any one of these, make sure to use a VPN.
Use strong passwords.
Simple passwords are easy for hackers to guess, and using the same password on multiple sites can put all your accounts at risk. If one account is hacked, it could give hackers access to your other accounts. To protect yourself, ensure each account has a strong and unique password.

                        Malware, short for malicious software, is a kind of harmful code or program that can damage.
Researchers often categorise malware into different types, such as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware and keyloggers.
Malware can access, scramble, or erase information, and lock a device.
It can also show unwanted ads, make the device easier to hack, or change how it works.
Malware can spread when you open an infected file, run a program, or start a script.
Malware refers to harmful software created to compromise or damage computer systems and networks.
